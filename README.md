Project Overview:
This project involves creating a simple webpage that features Recipes. The webpage includes links to recipes with a brief description of the recipe, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions. Additionally, there's an appealing image to complement the presentation.

Demonstrated Skills:
Upon completion, this project showcases proficiency in HTML, the foundational language for creating web content. Key skills demonstrated include structuring a webpage with proper HTML tags, incorporating images, creating lists, creating links and formatting text. The project also emphasizes attention to detail, as seen in the organization of recipe details and the use of semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and search engine optimization.

Self-reflection:
I loved this project as I gained a deeper understanding of structuring content with html. It allowed me to practice organizing information and using various HTML elements effectively.
I hope you like this project as much as I did and I hope coming back to it when I learn more about CSS and JavaScript!!!
